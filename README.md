# OCR_TEXT

This project aims to develop an AI-powered system for extracting text from images, with a special focus on making information from hard-to-read or historical documents accessible and searchable.

## 1. Purpose

The main purpose of this project is to use Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract names from documents. This is particularly valuable for individuals interested in genealogical research, such as discovering the names of descendants or ancestors in records from platforms like FamilySearch.

## 2. Application

By digitizing names and other relevant information from old or challenging documents, the project helps users trace family histories and build family trees more efficiently. The extracted data can be used to support research, preserve heritage, and connect generations.
